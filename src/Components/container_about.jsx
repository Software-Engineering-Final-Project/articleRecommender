                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p className="ml-2">
                    A large portion of the worldâ€™s population is diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In
                    America alone, recent studies have shown that 1 in 68 Americans are born with ASD. While
                    a significant proportion of individuals have been diagnosed with ASD, they are one of the most
                    underrepresented demographics.
